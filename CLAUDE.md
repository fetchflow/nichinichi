# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
with code in this repository.

---

## Project Overview

**Nichinichi** is a local-first developer personal knowledge base and journal
with an AI layer. Developers log daily activities via CLI or desktop app.
All data lives as markdown files on the local filesystem. SQLite is a
reconstructable query index — never the source of truth. There is no
login screen and no network dependency for core features.

---

## Design

- No authentication required — the app opens directly to the dashboard
- All data local: markdown files + SQLite
- FTS via SQLite FTS5
- AI via user-supplied API key (entered in Settings UI, saved to
  `~/.nichinichi.yml`)
- Git is the backup and multi-machine sync mechanism
- The `SyncTarget` trait in `crates/sync` provides the seam for future
  sync backends without requiring changes to Tauri commands or CLI

---

## Stack

- All backend logic (parser, sync, AI, CLI) is **Rust**
- Desktop UI is **Tauri v2** (Rust backend + React/TypeScript/Tailwind
  frontend)
- The `nichinichi` CLI binary and Tauri desktop app share the same Rust
  crates
- No separate web server, no Python packages, no Node.js backend

**`nichinichi.db` is gitignored.** It is always reconstructable by running
`nichinichi sync --rebuild`. The markdown files are the only data that needs
to be backed up. Users commit and push `~/nichinichi/` (excluding `nichinichi.db`)
to their own private git remote.

## File Formats

### Daily entry file (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

```markdown
# 2026-03-17

---
09:05 | picking up the auth refactor @acme #log
---
11:32 | jwt refresh swallowing errors — fixed @acme #solution

       Root cause: expiry check after decode, not before
       Fix: move expiry check to top of middleware
       Time lost: 2hrs. Check expiry BEFORE decode, always.
---
14:15 | claude suggested localStorage — rejected, xss risk @acme #ai

  model: claude-sonnet-4-5

# default org for entries with no @org tag and no project .nichinichi.yml
default_org: personal

# project-level .nichinichi.yml (in any project root)
# project: api-refactor
# org: acme
```

---

## Parser Rules (`crates/parser`)

### Entry parser

- File header: `# YYYY-MM-DD`
- Entry delimiter: `---` on its own line (opens and closes each entry)
- Entry first line: `HH:MM | body text @org #type #extra-tags`
- Approximate timestamp: `~HH:MM` — stored with `approximate: true`
- `@word` → `org` field (first `@mention` wins; overrides `.nichinichi.yml`
  default)
- `#word` → type tag if it matches a known type, otherwise pushed to
  `tags[]`
- Known types: `log`, `solution`, `decision`, `reflection`, `score`, `ai`
- If no type tag: infer from body keywords (see type inference rules below)
- Detail block: indented lines below the first line (optional)
- Idempotent upsert key: `(date, time, body)` — no `user_id` in local mode

### Type inference rules

```
body contains "fixed","solved","workaround","the fix"  → solution
body contains "chose","decided","rejected","picked"    → decision
body contains "clicked","realised","learned","finally" → reflection
body contains "shipped","merged","closed","unblocked"  → score
body contains "claude","gpt","ai","prompt","copilot"   → ai
else                                                    → log
```

### Goal parser

- YAML frontmatter block between `---` delimiters
- `## steps` section: `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checkboxes
- Step metadata (notes, due) as indented key-value lines below each step
- `## progress` section: `### YYYY-MM-DD` subsections with `signal:` and
  `note:` fields
- Signal values: `breakthrough`, `strong`, `steady`, `moderate`,
  `struggling`, `quiet`

### Digest / AI conversation parser

- YAML frontmatter only; body is raw markdown content
- Indexed into SQLite `digests` table for dashboard queries
- Body stored verbatim — not re-parsed for entries

### Org resolution order (for any file)

1. Inline `@org` tag in the entry line
2. `org:` in the nearest `.nichinichi.yml` walking up from `process.cwd()`
3. `default_org` in `~/.nichinichi.yml`
4. `null` (unscoped / personal)

---

## SQLite Schema (`~/nichinichi/nichinichi.db`)

This database is **always reconstructable** from the markdown files via
`nichinichi sync --rebuild`. Never treat it as a source of truth.
It is gitignored.

## Architecture

### Data flow (CLI)

```
nichinichi "text @acme #solution"
  → resolves org from @mention or nearest .nichinichi.yml
  → appends entry to ~/nichinichi/YYYY-MM-DD.md
  → triggers sync: parser reads file → upserts to SQLite
```

### Data flow (Desktop)

```
Frontend invoke()
  → Tauri command (Rust)
  → same parser/sync/ai crates
  → reads/writes markdown files
  → upserts to SQLite
  → returns result to frontend
```

### Sync / rebuild flow

```
nichinichi sync --rebuild
  → drops all reconstructable tables (entries, goals, playbooks,
    digests, goal_steps, goal_progress, goal_step_entries)
  → walks ~/nichinichi/ recursively (excluding .quiet/, nichinichi.db)
  → parses every .md file by type (daily | goal | playbook | digest | ai)
  → upserts all parsed records into SQLite
  → rebuilds FTS5 index
  → preserves: goal_suggestions, settings (non-reconstructable)
```

### File watcher

Spawned as a tokio background task in `lib.rs::start_file_watcher`.
Uses a dedicated `std::thread` for the blocking `notify` event loop,
forwarding triggers via `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel (capacity 1,
`try_send` deduplicates rapid saves). Excludes `.quiet/` and
`nichinichi.db`. On change: re-parses the affected file and upserts to
SQLite. Does not require a full rebuild for single-file changes.

### AI streaming

- CLI: SSE chunks printed to stdout as they arrive
- Desktop: Rust emits `ai-chunk` / `ai-done` Tauri events →
  frontend `listen()`s and appends to conversation
- Queries use SQLite FTS5 (`MATCH` queries) to build context
- `.quiet/` entries never included in AI context under any circumstances
- Org filter applied to AI queries when an org is active

### Save AI conversation (opt-in)

When the user saves an AI conversation (CLI flag or desktop button):
- Rust writes a new file to `~/nichinichi/ai/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- File watcher picks it up and indexes it into SQLite
- Slug auto-generated from the query text (lowercase, hyphenated,
  truncated to 60 chars) unless user provides one

### Write-back (UI → markdown)

When the user modifies a goal's steps, progress, or metadata via the
desktop UI, the Tauri command writes the change back to the goal's
`.md` file directly. SQLite is updated in the same transaction.
The file watcher debounces to avoid re-parsing a file that was just
written by the app itself (skip if modified_by == 'app').

### System tray

Built via `tauri::tray::TrayIconBuilder` (requires `tray-icon`
feature). Menu: Sync now, Quit. Left-click shows/focuses the window.

### Auto-launch

`tauri-plugin-autostart` with `MacosLauncher::LaunchAgent`. Toggle in
Settings UI (saved to `settings` table). Only functional in bundled
builds. `bundle.active: false` in `tauri.conf.json` for dev.

### Skeleton loading states

`Skeleton.tsx` (`SkeletonRow`, `SkeletonBlock`) + `.skeleton` CSS class
with `skeleton-pulse` keyframe in `globals.css`. Used in Feed, Stats,
Goals, Dashboard graphs.

---

## SyncTarget Trait

Defined in `crates/sync`. `LocalSqlite` is the only implementation.
The trait provides a seam for adding additional sync backends without
touching Tauri commands or CLI code.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait SyncTarget: Send + Sync {
    async fn upsert_entry(&self, entry: &ParsedEntry) -> Result<()>;
    async fn upsert_goal(&self, goal: &Goal) -> Result<()>;
    async fn upsert_playbook(&self, playbook: &Playbook) -> Result<()>;
    async fn upsert_digest(&self, digest: &Digest) -> Result<()>;
    async fn delete_entry(&self, id: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn rebuild(&self) -> Result<()>;
}

pub struct LocalSqlite {
    pub pool: SqlitePool,  // sqlx pool
}
```

---

## Org Filtering

Orgs are discovered dynamically — no registry needed. The parser
extracts all distinct `org` values encountered across all markdown
files and surfaces them as filter options in the UI.

**UI behaviour:**
- Org switcher in the top bar: All / Personal / [detected orgs]
- Defaults to All, persisted in `settings` table as `active_org`
- Dashboard stats, graphs, heatmap, goals snapshot all respect the
  active org filter
- AI ask panel searches only the active org's entries (or all if All)
- Log feed shows an org pill on each entry card alongside the project
  pill

**CLI behaviour:**
- `nichinichi ask "query" --org acme` overrides active org for that query
- Org inferred from working directory `.nichinichi.yml` when not specified

---

## Goal Lifecycle

```
goals/active/slug.md   (status: active | paused)
       ↓  mark done or abandoned via UI or CLI
goals/archive/slug.md  (status: done | abandoned, completion_date added)
```

When a goal is archived:
1. Tauri command renames/moves the file from `goals/active/` to
   `goals/archive/`
2. Adds `completion_date: YYYY-MM-DD` to the frontmatter
3. Updates SQLite `goals.status` and `goals.file_path`

When a goal suggestion is accepted:
1. New step appended to the `## steps` section of the goal `.md` file
2. SQLite `goal_steps` updated
3. `goal_suggestions` row status set to `accepted`

---

## Archive (daily files)

Daily entry files accumulate in the `~/nichinichi/` root during their
active year. Year rollover is triggered by:
- `nichinichi archive --year 2025` (explicit)
- Automatically on first launch of a new year (with confirmation prompt)

Archive moves files: `~/nichinichi/2025-*.md` → `~/nichinichi/archive/2025/`

The file watcher and parser recurse into `archive/` — archived entries
remain fully searchable. Archiving is organisational only; nothing is
deleted.

urlencoding      = "2"
```

**Note:** `sqlx` with the `sqlite` feature replaces the previous
`rusqlite` direct usage. Use `sqlx::SqlitePool` with
`tokio::task::spawn_blocking` where blocking calls are unavoidable.
Migrations live in `crates/sync/migrations/`.

## Config (`~/.nichinichi.yml`)

```yaml
repo: ~/nichinichi
editor: vim          # $EDITOR fallback

ai:
  base_url: https://api.anthropic.com  # or Ollama, LiteLLM, Open WebUI
  api_key: ""                          # entered via Settings UI
  model: claude-sonnet-4-5

default_org: personal                  # fallback when no @org and no
                                       # project .nichinichi.yml
```

AI key is entered once in the Settings UI and written to this file.
No environment variables required for normal desktop use. CLI falls
back to `AI_API_KEY` / `AI_BASE_URL` / `AI_MODEL` env vars if the
config file is absent.

---

## Environment Variables (CLI fallback only)

```bash
AI_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
AI_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
AI_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5
```

These are only needed for CLI use without a `~/.nichinichi.yml`. The
desktop app always reads from the config file.

## Key Decisions

- Cargo workspace `resolver = "2"` — required for Tauri v2
- `thiserror` in library crates, `anyhow` in binary crates only
- `sqlx` (not `rusqlite`) for async-native SQLite access
- SQLite is a reconstructable query index — markdown files are the
  source of truth for all entries, goals, playbooks, and digests
- `nichinichi.db` is gitignored — reconstruction via `nichinichi sync --rebuild`
  is the recovery path on any new machine
- `goal_suggestions` and `settings` are the only SQLite-only data —
  they are not written to markdown and are cleared on rebuild
- `@org` tags are first-class parsed fields, not stored in `tags[]`
- Orgs are discovered dynamically from file content — no org registry
- `SyncTarget` trait with `LocalSqlite` implementation in `crates/sync`
  — adding a new sync backend requires no changes to commands or CLI
- Goal write-back: UI changes to goals are written to the `.md` file
  first, SQLite second — file is always authoritative
- File watcher skips re-parsing files modified by the app itself
  (write-back guard) to avoid parse→write→parse loops
- `tauri::Manager` must be in scope to call `get_webview_window`
- `tauri::Emitter` must be in scope to call `app.emit()`
- File watcher uses `std::thread` for blocking notify loop +
  `tokio::sync::mpsc` for async bridge
- `bundle.active: false` in `tauri.conf.json` for dev; autostart
  requires a bundled build
- No authentication — app opens directly to dashboard
- `.quiet/` entries are never indexed, never sent to AI, never synced
  under any circumstances — this is enforced in the file watcher and
  the sync rebuild, not just the UI
